# bootest
A simple contacts CRUD with Spring Boot, Hibernate, Flyway, Thymeleaf and Bootstrap

You will need create a database with name: **boot_contacts**. When you going to run the application, it automatically creates the schema.

You will need also configure the build path, adding the Apache Tomcat libraries to the project. It's necessary, because this settings are to run with a external Apache Tomcat.

If you don't want do this, you should change the **pom.xml** to use the embedded Apache Tomcat.

Enjoy it.
